# Production Deployment Test Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the testing of the Evolve application deployment to Vercel's production environment and the OpenRouter API integration.

## Deployment Status
‚úÖ **DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL**
- Production URL: https://evolve-ckbk2l1qp-aajs-projects-6d581e87.vercel.app
- Build Status: ‚úÖ Compiled successfully
- Environment: Production
- Deployment ID: dpl_7YT1bDwRmXoSDUwKB24FNgu2bZjc

## Environment Configuration
‚úÖ **ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES CONFIGURED**
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: ‚úÖ Present in Vercel (encrypted)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`: ‚úÖ Present in Vercel (encrypted)
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`: ‚úÖ Present in Vercel (encrypted)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: ‚úÖ Present in Vercel (encrypted)

## Application Architecture
‚úÖ **APPLICATION STRUCTURE**
- Next.js 15.3.5 with Turbopack
- React 19.0.0
- API Routes: `/api/chat`, `/api/chat/stream`, `/api/test`
- Pages: `/`, `/chat`, `/dashboard`
- Authentication: Clerk integration
- Styling: Tailwind CSS

## API Integration Testing

### OpenRouter API Status
‚ùå **API KEY ISSUE IDENTIFIED**
- Status: 401 Unauthorized
- Error: "No auth credentials found"
- API Key Present: ‚úÖ Yes (73 characters, prefix: sk-or-v1-d)
- Issue: API key appears to be expired or invalid

### Test Results
```
Primary Model (thudm/glm-4-32b:free): ‚ùå 401 Unauthorized
Fallback Models: ‚ùå Same authentication issue
Mock AI Fallback: ‚úÖ Working as expected
```

## Production Logs Analysis
From Vercel production logs:
```
‚ùå PRIMARY model failed (thudm/glm-4-32b:free): Error [AxiosError]: Request failed with status code 401
Primary model error details: {
  status: 401,
  statusText: 'Unauthorized',
  data: { error: { message: 'No auth credentials found', code: 401 } },
  message: 'Request failed with status code 401',
  model: 'thudm/glm-4-32b:free'
}
```

## Security & Access Control
‚úÖ **VERCEL PROTECTION ACTIVE**
- Production deployment is protected by Vercel authentication
- API endpoints require authentication for external access
- This is a security feature preventing unauthorized access

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **üîë Refresh OpenRouter API Key**
   - Current key appears to be expired/invalid
   - Generate new API key from OpenRouter dashboard
   - Update environment variables in Vercel

2. **üîÑ Re-deploy After Key Update**
   - Update `.env.local` with new API key
   - Push changes to trigger new deployment
   - Re-test API functionality

### Long-term Improvements
1. **üìä API Key Health Monitoring**
   - Add API key validation on startup
   - Implement health check endpoint
   - Monitor API quota usage

2. **üîß Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Better fallback responses
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Retry logic for transient failures

3. **üìù Documentation**
   - API key setup guide
   - Deployment checklist
   - Troubleshooting guide

## Test Commands Used
```bash
# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Check environment variables
vercel env ls

# Pull environment variables
vercel env pull .env.local

# Check deployment logs
vercel logs https://evolve-ckbk2l1qp-aajs-projects-6d581e87.vercel.app

# Test API key manually
node test-openrouter.js
```

## Conclusion
The deployment to Vercel production was **successful**, but the OpenRouter API integration is currently failing due to an invalid/expired API key. The application architecture is sound, environment variables are properly configured, and the fallback mechanisms are working as expected.

**Next Steps:**
1. Obtain a valid OpenRouter API key
2. Update the environment variables
3. Re-deploy and test the chat functionality
4. Monitor the application for any additional issues
