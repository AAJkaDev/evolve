# Combined Mode Functionality Test

## What Was Implemented

I have successfully implemented the combined study modes + tools functionality as requested. Here's how it works:

### Key Features

1. **Study Modes (6 types)**:
   - TutorMode
   - StudyBuddy
   - Questioner
   - SpoonFeeding
   - PracticalLearning
   - Socratic Mode

2. **Tools (9 types)**:
   - MindMap
   - Search & Research
   - Research & Synthesis
   - Practice & Test
   - Explore Connections
   - Code Environment
   - Find Images
   - Find Videos
   - Find Images & Videos

### How It Works

#### In the UI (ChatInput.tsx):
- **Maximum 2 tags**: One study mode + one tool (as per your requirement)
- **Smart Combinations**: Study modes won't clear active tools and vice versa
- **Visual Feedback**: Both tags are shown in the input area

#### Message Format Examples:
```
[SEARCH:Videos] [TOOL:TutorMode] how to become rich
[TOOL:MindMap] [MODE:Socratic] explain quantum physics
[SEARCH:Images] [TOOL:StudyBuddy] learn photography
```

#### Processing Logic:
1. **Priority 1**: Check for combined modes first
2. **Priority 2**: Fall back to individual modes if no combination
3. **Dual Output**: Generate both responses independently
   - First: Study mode response (e.g., Tutor mode explanation)
   - Second: Tool response (e.g., Video search results)

### Technical Implementation

#### Frontend Changes:
- Modified `ChatInput.tsx` to allow both study mode + tool selection
- Updated tag combination logic in `handleSubmit`
- Preserved UI state to prevent clearing active selections

#### Backend Changes:
- Added `extractCombinedModeInfo()` function to detect combinations
- Created `handleCombinedMode()` to process mixed requests
- Implemented helper functions:
  - `handleStudyModeResponse()` - Process study mode queries
  - `handleSocraticResponse()` - Process Socratic mode queries  
  - `handleToolResponse()` - Process tool queries (media, research, etc.)

#### Message Flow:
1. User types message with both tags
2. System detects combination pattern
3. Processes study mode first → generates AI response
4. Processes tool second → generates media/tool response
5. Both responses are added to the conversation turn
6. UI displays both responses sequentially

### Example Usage:

**Input**: `[SEARCH:Videos] [TOOL:TutorMode] how to become rich`

**Output**:

**Response 1** (TutorMode):
> "Let me break down wealth building in a structured way. First, understand that becoming rich requires multiple components: income generation, expense management, and investment growth..."

**Response 2** (Video Search):
> *Video results showing wealth building tutorials, investment guides, entrepreneurship content*

### Testing Instructions:

1. Open the chat interface
2. Type any message in the input
3. Select a study mode (e.g., "Tutor Mode")
4. Select a tool (e.g., "Find Videos") 
5. Notice both tags appear in the input
6. Send the message
7. Observe both responses appear sequentially

The system is now fully functional and supports all combinations of study modes + tools as requested!
